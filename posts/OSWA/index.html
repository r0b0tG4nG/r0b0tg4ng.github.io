Students will obtain a wide variety of skill sets and competencies for web app assessments.</p><p>Students who complete the course and pass the associated exam earn the Offensive Security Web Assessor (OSWA) certification, demonstrating their ability to leverage modern web exploitation techniques on modern applications. <strong>A certified OSWA candidate is prepared to take on the Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation (WEB-300) course</strong>.</p><p><strong>&gt; Side Story:..</strong><br /></p><p>A lot of people think when you work at Offensive Security, you are given special privileges during an exam…🤣 let me share with you a secret. <strong>There Is No Special Treatment for Any OffSec Employee. You Have to Read The Course Module, Take On The Labs, Book An Exam Through The Portal &amp; Also You Will Have To Go Through Proctoring Verification &amp; Your Exam Will be Proctored Until The End.</strong> There are no special privileges offered to Any OffSec Employees During Exams we all go through the same procedure just like every other student.</p><p><strong>&gt; The Boring Story begins…..</strong><br /></p><p>On May 6th 2022, I was granted access to <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/learn/"> Offensive Security Learn Unlimited</a> which I started with PEN-300 journey. Two months into studying PEN-300, I realized I was not prepared for that exam since some part of this course is heavily dependent on <strong>C#</strong> programming. I took a step back asked myself these questions:</p><ol><li>How good is your C# skill??<li>Are your AD skills good??<li>Are you mentally prepared for OSEP?</ol><p>With these questions in mind, I decided it’s best to switch to a different a course while preparing myself for PEN-300. On August 12 2022, I started with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WEB-200</code> course materials. As usual you know my style of doing things… I jumped straight into pwning the labs without reading course materials. This method works best for me… Why? Because from this, i will be able to test out what I know against what I am about to study. Few days into the lab, I got stuck on exploiting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XSS</code> vulnerability my first box. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Oops thought I know it all got to jump back to the course material</code>🤪.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206197410-621ed03f-919f-465a-bcec-db1149294484.png" alt="image" /></p><p><strong>&gt; Fast Forward: Course Materials &amp; Labs…..</strong><br /></p><p>In the course materials, after trying my hands on some of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XSS example labs</code>, I figured a way to exploit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XSS vuln</code>. AT this point I knew exactly what to do/ the path to take… This secret path is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Try lab machine, get stuck then jump to course material and read on the related vulnerability</code>. This continued for some time till I was able to fully compromise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3/5 lab machines</code>. At this point, I stopped both reading the course materials and trying the lab machines. A friend advised the best way to see things clearer is to try looking at the problem from both sides. What this means is… <em>“master the skill of identifying same vulnerabilities from different angles”</em>. One of the best platforms to study web exploitations apart from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WEB-200</code>materials is <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs">PortSwigger</a> I quickly created an account, looked through the PortSwigger labs for topics that appear in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WEB-200</code> course material. I spent close to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">45 days</code> on PortSwigger labs… took much time that I anticipated because I had to manage work and study time. After spending 45 days on PortSwigger, I made a big progress solving a total of <strong>60 labs</strong><br /></p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206200262-3a6afe98-5cf1-4b48-b25c-e1a26ab2e2df.png" alt="image" /></p><p>It’s time to test what I learnt from PortSwigger. Unfortunately, my focus was needed elsewhere <em>(work😊)</em>…. Early October, the work load reduced and it was time for another ride. Jumped back to the labs with the knowledge I acquired from PortSwigger. I made good progress on the labs but guess what, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WEB-200</code> course materials has a lot of goodies in it. I had to return to the course material to read more on vulnerability discovery and exploitation techniques. Armed with good information from both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Web-200</code> course material and PortSwigger labs as well as the support from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OffSec Discord channel</code>, I finally compromised the remaining labs. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5/5 OSWA Labs</code> compromised while I’ve read through only <em>39.1%</em> of the course materials.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206192550-b39bc856-e470-4d23-8926-b569c3422299.png" alt="image" /></p><p><strong>&gt; Discussion: Course Material vs PortSwigger Labs</strong><br /></p><p>Alright let me add my voice to this discussion…. I will start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PortSwigger labs</code>, It is without any doubt that PortSwigger labs contain rich resources and it’s rated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Number 1</code> on almost every blog that I have read but this doesn’t mean that you will do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100% fine</code> without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OffSec Lab Materials</code>. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Web-200</code> course content, I’ve learned a lot more than I could imagine about exploiting web application vunerabilities. In short, it was an eye opener.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OffSec</code> did a great job in breaking down the explanations of all vulnerabilities and also provide exercise for all instances that’s mentioned in the course content. My best advice is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"These platforms offer an opportunity to learn. As far as you are learning something new and beneficial from these platforms/materials, I don’t think there is a need to argue/compare which one is the best/better"</code> I have learnt a lot from these platforms and I will advise you to do same for your own good 🤗 Remember you are studying for yourself and not the community😜. Therefore, refrain from engaging in these poor arguments.</p><h2 id="-exam-preparations-">&gt; Exam Preparations <br /></h2><p><strong>&gt; Note Taking and Site Bookmarking..</strong><br /></p><p>While studying on both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PortSwigger</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSWA course materials</code>, I made sure I wrote down all payloads I used in both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exercises</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">labs</code>. Most times, I will include a small detail explaining why a payload will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">work or fail</code> (I will talk about this later). Let’s take a look at a sample of my notes: <img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206215057-6db8196e-7d3e-4e60-94b1-a18dfc955c7f.png" alt="image" /></p><p>Using this method of note taking, I was able to accumulate a very big cheatsheet for web applications. Accurate note taking helped me a lot during my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSWA</code> exam because there were instances where I will need to only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy and paste</code> a payload with or without changing anything in the payload. This is a very important step and I will advise one shouldn’t rush to compromise/finish all the labs or exercises but rather taking your time to understand the vulnerability as well as discover multiple ways of exploiting that vulnerability.</p><p>Having this in mind, I made sure I went through all the course material not leaving any stone unturned. On November 28 2022, I completed almost all topics in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSWA Course material</code>.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206217164-915d88b3-c4a5-4ce2-a160-41773ee188d9.png" alt="image" /></p><p><strong>&gt; Pre-Exam Tip..</strong><br /></p><p>Never assume that a vulnerability won’t be included to an exam lab. Otherwise, you risk ending up stranded like me in the exam. Because, the vulnerability i least expected to see turned out to be present on one of my exam machines. I nearly failed my exam because I was of the mindset that <strong>“There was no way it will show up.”</strong> Every vulnerability covered in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSWA course</code> is likely to be implemented on any exam machine… My advice is: <strong>“Stay concentrated, learn everything, understand everything, and be ready for everything.”</strong></p><p><strong>&gt; So It Begins: Booking Exam</strong><br /></p><p>The funny part was I got a little bit bored after completing the course materials and also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PortSwigger labs</code> so I decided to start playing with web applications from <a href="https://hacktheforce.net/">HackTheForce</a> anytime I got stuck exploiting a vulnerability I will go knocking the doors of my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kleiton0x7e">Kleiton Kurti</a> <strong>( a little secret “he’s a monster when it comes to webapps” 😜)</strong>…… In a nutshell, I scheduled my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSWA Exam</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">December 3rd 2022</code> at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">22:00 GMT</code> as usual of me a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">night owl</code>🦉.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206223453-0f8dad86-310f-467c-a04d-d83734092fa4.png" alt="image" /></p><p>Still not satisfied with <a href="https://hacktheforce.net/">HackTheForce</a> instances, I decided to participate in <strong>PwnTillDawn Middle East &amp; Africa CTF Competition</strong> as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exam stress test-run</code> hoping i will find some web applications to testm my skills…The CTF took place from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">November 30 2022</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">December 2nd 2022</code>… Remember my exam is scheduled on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">December 3rd 2022</code>. Luckily for me, I managed to win the competition🎉🎊🥳.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206231349-39a6da38-ac81-4213-a050-11589a9f7741.png" alt="image" /></p><p><strong>&gt; Exam D-Day: New Age Begins</strong><br /></p><p>On <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">December 3rd, 2022</code>, I woke up at 9am (still stressed from the CTF), time to rest…. i hope so…. Well, here is my little secret: on days of execution, I try as much as possible to stay away from computers else I will end up trying to compromise vulnerable web instances. To avoid touching my laptop, i did some painting jobs at home…. At <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2:00 pm GMT</code> I took a short nap till <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2:45 pm GMT</code> then jumped back to painting work…</p><p>At 8pm exactly, I turned on my laptop checking all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VM Snapshots</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notes</code>. As usual I selected a music playlist from YouTube for the exam (morale Boosters). In case you want to know, here is the playlist:</p><blockquote><ol><li>Jahmiel Success Scary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81hz4BNKNB8">Watch Video</a><li>Sami Yusuf - Make Me Strong <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3lqPUbYyTM"> Watch Video</a><li>Zootopia - Try Everything (Lyrics, Shakira)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpqV3dzYOgk"> Watch Video</a></ol></blockquote><p>At <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9:30 pm GMT</code> I logged into the proctoring tool, did all the necessary checks. Well!!! well!! well!…. the journey begins exactly at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10:15 PM GMT</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">December 3rd 2022</code>.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9hrs</code> into the exam, I managed to acquire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50 points</code> <strong>(3 local.txt &amp; 2 proof.txt)</strong> all I need now is an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extra 20 points</code> to pass the exam. Everything was moving smoothly and I was happy about it, I even thought i will finish the exam in the next <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3/4hrs</code> little did I know that there was a <strong>HUGE roadblock ahead</strong>. On the quest for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extra 20points</code>, I got stuck for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7hrs</code> on the remaining targets. Almost lost hope in compromising these targets because I tried everything I learnt but none worked. I knew I was missing a piece of information from the experience I had with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSWA lab machines</code> anytime you get stuck for a while there are two things involved.</p><ol><li>You are missing a piece of the puzzle<li>You are trying to exploit a wrong vulnerability (Applicationg may be vulnerable to what you have in mind but that’s not the right vulnerability to exploit)</ol><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">19hrs</code> into the exam, just when the I started to feel pressured and useless(i usually feel this way whenever things don’t go my way… This usually inspires me to push beyond my limits), I saw a vulnerability that was staring right at me all that while. A vulnerability I least thought they will implement in an exam. Once discovered, I was able to exploit this vulnerability in less than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10mins</code> to get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local.txt</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">30-40mins</code> of enumerating, I achieved code execution on the target to retrieve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proof.txt</code>. hehehe now I have <strong>70 points (3 proof.txt and 4 local.txt)</strong> which is the required pass mark. I took a step back to doublecheck all screenshots, comments and payloads in my notes that I will need for report writing. In the process of going through the screenshots in my notes, I saw something interesting in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wfuzz</code> screenshot. I quickly accessed that page. Guess what, it was the missing piece I needed. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">45 minutes</code> of testing and firing my payloads I achieved Code execution and was able to retrieve the fourth <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proof.txt</code>, As for the 5th target…. I Won’t talk about it. I spent 7hrs+ on it exploiting a vulnerability that I was certain was the intended path, just like my OSCP exam which I found a privilege escalation point but couldn’t exploit it, the same thing happened to me on this exam.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">80 points acquired</code>, this is definitely a pass mark. The last and stressful part of the journey begins. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Report writing</code> i think is the most stressful part of an exam. Even if you are able to exploit all targets but you fail to make a good report, you are likely to fail. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20mins</code> before the exam ended, I submitted the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proof.txt</code>, used the remaining time to update my screenshots, comments and payloads in my notes. You should have seen the joy on my face hahaha I went back YouTube to listen to my favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81hz4BNKNB8">Jahmiel - Success Scary</a></p><p>On <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Monday December 5th, 2022</code> at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6:30-7pm GMT</code> I submitted my report. Am I the only one that get scared after submitting a report? I read through my report a couple of times before and after submitting. Trying to make sure I didn’t mess up anywhere. On <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wednesday December 7 2022</code> I finally got the email I’ve been waiting for.</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67085453/206420201-fe4b1752-ad9b-4ee1-a5c2-f21a6586f460.png" alt="image" /></p><p>I am super excited to pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OSWA Exam</code> on my first attempt.

Don’t forget to make notes while you’re going through that. Read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bug hunting blogs</code> too <strong>(maybe going too far)</strong> I did that and it helped me.
